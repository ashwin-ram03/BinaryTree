# BinaryTree
Just a basic example of a binary tree and a print method that poses 3 different depth first search traversals:

1. Post order traversal
2. Pre Order Traversal
3. In order traversal

Given a tree with 7 nodes, one root with a left child and a right child, and then each left and right child having their own left and right childs respectively.
